This is a quick guide to help you get started with profiling RimWorld using a custom build of the Mono runtime matching its Unity version.

This approach leverages the fact that Linux has a powerful kernel-level profiling tool (`perf`) and that Mono, the .NET runtime used by Unity/RimWorld, already implements the necessary scaffolding that allows `perf` to find the symbols for the JITed managed code. All that is needed is a tiny patch to allow toggling the JIT symbol map generation.

1. Check out this repository and branch somewhere convenient.
2. Get the [build dependencies](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/compiling-mono/linux/).
3. Set appropriate compiler flags to get a build that will be suitable for profiling:
```sh
# PIC is needed to successfully link against dependent libraries
export LDFLAGS="-fpic"
# Preserve frame pointers and debug symbols.
export CFLAGS="-O2 -fPIC -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -pipe
```
4. Build Mono:
```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make -j$(nproc)
```
Note: On recent systems, the build may fail when attempting to compile the C# standard libraries shipped by Mono. This can be safely ignored, since we do not need those to profile RimWorldâ€”we only need the runtime itself, which will have already been compiled by then.

5. Back up the original Mono runtime bundled with RimWorld and copy over the new one:
```
$ cp ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/RimWorld/RimWorldLinux_Data/MonoBleedingEdge/x86_64/libmonobdwgc-2.0.so /somewhere/safe
$ cp mono/mini/.libs/libmonobdwgc-2.0.so.1.0.0 ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/RimWorld/RimWorldLinux_Data/MonoBleedingEdge/x86_64/libmonobdwgc-2.0.so
```
6. Configure RimWorld to start with the environment variable `MONO_DEBUG=disable_omit_fp`, which will disable frame pointers in JIT-ed code and activate JIT map creation for `perf` at the same time. This is easiest via Steam launch options.
7. Start RimWorld to check if the Mono runtime is working as intended. There should be a `/tmp/perf-PID.map` file created with RimWorld's PID if everything went well.
8. Clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph somewhere.
9. Profile RimWorld to your liking, and use Brendan Gregg's scripts or `perf` itself to make sense of the output. See [Brendan Gregg's site](https://brendangregg.com/perf.html) for many useful examples.
For instance, to capture stack samples of a running RimWorld for 60 seconds at 99 Hz, and turn the results into a flamegraph:
```
# perf record -F 99 -p $(pidof RimWorldLinux) -g -- sleep 60
# perf script | /path/to/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | /path/to/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl > graph.svg
```
